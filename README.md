# Filtering-sexist-text
This project is aimed at converting offensive, sexist text into pleasant or funny  sentences.

- Cyberbullying is pervasive in our society.

- Marginalized groups such as women, people of color, and the lgbtq+ community are especially targeted by cyberbullies on social media.

- Cyberbullying can have serious effects on the victims mental health and can even become life threatening.

- The goal is to inject humor and positivity, replacing insults and slurs.

- Through NLP and ML  offensive language is identified within a sentence or tweet.

- Once identified, the language is replaced with antonyms or silly words
